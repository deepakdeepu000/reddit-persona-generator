POST_3:
  Title: Can you actually “work” in AVP?
  Subreddit: r/VisionPro
  Content: I’m curious if people have been able to fully port their workflow into AVP. I’ve been trying to actually use the Vision Pro to get some work done, but without github and visual studio code, it’s not been the easiest (also obviously no terminal). I could use Mac virtual display, but since I have a M1 MBP the latency is noticeable to the point it’s an adverse experience. I already dropped $4k on this device, renewing my MBP just so I can use it with my AVP is asking a bit too much… Also where’s Xcode? If Apple wants AVP to be a “work device”, they gotta have at least Xcode right? I can get the simple stuff like emails done through AVP, but if this device can’t replace my entire workflow, I don’t know if I can justify the price. I’m sure it’ll get resolved down the line (more of a software issue than hardware constraints), but curious to hear how realistic it is for people to port over their workflow to AVP, and what apps you’d like to see ASAP.

  Title: Would you guys like to see Pokemon Go in AVP?
  Subreddit: r/VisionPro
  Content: Hi guys, I think Pokemon could be one of the killer use case for the vision pro. Imagine, you could fight players from around the world from the comfort of your couch. With the recent controversy around Palworld, they're looking for the next "Pokemon Go" that would propel their franchise to the next level. Being Japanese, I happen to know a few key decision makers both in the Pokemon Company as well as Niantic. Alot of the in-game designs are transferrable, and I believe it's a matter of time until Niantic's Lightship ARDK will work on AVP. What should I tell them? Lmk if you have thoughts or useful links/videos I should forward to them. I'm confident that this will eventually become a thing, but the faster they ship the more AVP adoption we'll see.

  Comment: The founders may have had good intentions, but they definitely didn’t deliver on them. As for the brands that veve partnered with, they probably saw it more as a marketing opportunity, and considering how a few people care about NFTs, they see the impact of their apathy as negligible to the overall brand image. Disney for instance, have received way more flack about trying to use Disney+ terms and conditions on the victim who died in their theme park. The reality is that mainstream attention has moved away from NFTs (if there ever was any), and so they’ve written it off as one of the many, many things they’d like to sweep under the rug.

  Comment: I think there's a stark difference between fetishizing and respecting a certain culture. If you're putting up Japanese artwork as art and is respecting it, I doubt any Japanese person will take offense. But making some cheap piece of clothing and branding it as "kimono" since it will sell better is disrespectful in my eyes. I think the keyword here is "authenticity" and "respect". As long as one adopts a culture with these in mind, there is nothing wrong with it. But it's ultimately up to those who belong in the original culture to decide if these standards are being met. Obviously there is no "singular hive mind of Japanese consciousness", and the answer will depend from person to person. As Japan becomes more racially/culturally diverse (albeit slower than most other nations), these definitions will shift. A Ukrainian born woman (ethnically entirely white European) just became Ms. Japan, which led to alot of backlash. Personally I think this is a welcoming change as Japan embraces diversity, especially as she is much more culturally Japanese than most ethnically Japanese people. I feel Japan should redefine what it means to be Japanese, and cultural symbols like her or Osaka Naomi, Rui Hachimura, are pushing the envelope in a positive way. And to answer your question: Traditionally (pre industrial revolution) kimonos were worn by people of different social class for a variety of occasions. Kimono actually means "clothes", which includes sub categories such as samui (work clothes) or yukata (summer clothes). There's also a word for western clothes (洋服), which is what most people wear these days. In modern era, there are certain occasions you are more likely to see it (e.g. summer festivals, tea ceremony, black tie events), but it's not uncommon to see people wearing kimono on the streets any time of the year. Maybe it's worth having a conversation with your daughter-in-law to get her perspective on it.

  Comment: Not sure why you have so many downvotes, I think your comment is entirely valid. I’d say you have to experience it yourself to understand the difference. I’ve had the Quest 2 and Quest pro, and have built apps on the Meta store. So I’d say I’m more involved in the ecosystem than an average Apple consumer. I’d say the image quality, user experience, and seamlessness of the apple ecosytem can’t be understated (only applies if you are an iPhone/mac user). Being able to connect via your iPhone and not having to set up the Wi-Fi, or your AirPods automatically connecting to the device feels “magical”. I’m not convinced if I’ll keep the device though, it’s way too expensive and if this doesn’t entirely replace my Mac, or I want to build in the VR ecosystem again, I can’t justify the price. So far it‘s more of an iPad replacement in terms of productivity, and the verdict is yet to be out on if I want to build on this thing.

  Comment: I’ll preface by saying that I’m Japanese (have grown up half in Japan and half outside of Japan), so my perspective isn’t that of Taiwanese people. My understanding is Taiwan was the first major region that Japan occupied, and thus Japan put in a significant effort to create a model colony out of Taiwan. They surveyed the island, took biological records of the wildlife, and to an extent modernized Taiwan. I was surprised to see how a sizable portion of Taiwan’s natural history museum were contributions by Japanese scientists when I went to Taipei. However, I think it’s about how people in Taiwan perceive Japanese occupation which is relevant. This actually isn’t entirely about what Japan did in Taiwan, but what came after. The kuomintang led nationalist government committed mass murder (known as the 228 incident), which made those who lived through both eras look back fondly at the era of Japanese occupation. I’m not trying to justify colonialism, but feel that the atrocities by the nationalism government seems to have painted a (relatively) positive light of the Japanese occupation in the eyes of the elders. I am curious to hear a Taiwanese persons’ perspective on this though, because my understanding is that the occupying japanese forces also did their fair share of inhumane acts during the occupation.

  Comment: There are some key technologies which can give you significant advantage in the early game, either in military or in science. The ones for military are composite Bowmans, chariots, crossbow etc, but the great library doesn’t really help you obtain these since they’re on the opposite side of the tech tree. As in, if you want to beeline for those it’s faster to research those tech instead of researching and beelining for great library. I think the great library can be beneficial in getting to theology faster, which will get you to borobudur. That’s game changing if you are pushing for religion (which honestly you should unless there are reasons not to). The great scientist points are great to have early on, although you often use them for bulk popping once you have research labs up and running. I usually play at deity where the AI starts miles ahead in technology so don’t even bother, but if you’re playing king or emperor it should be a decent strat.
